I am working on building the Db context to communicate with the Database and allow creation of recipies through EF core and just using Razor views for now. 

Currently I am stuck as the part of implementing EF core , and the books suggests reviewing chapter 11 when actually it's chapter 13. Once i get past this. 

My goal will be to add recipies. search through a list of recipies with pictures if there is a picture availabile for that item. 

then I will need to look into a form of storing images other than the sql table potentially through Azure storage tables. 

need to document features of this application. 

Would also like to list other ideas and features here : 
	 - Identity login to share with friends and familt 
	
	 - publish website  

	- that's all for now
